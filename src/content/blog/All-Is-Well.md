The most powerful skillset is training your mind to more and more automatically see what is amazing and beautiful about any situation

*This is different than optimism*

Optimism is the belief that things will work out in a positive way

***But what if you control the definition of what is positive?***

The TRUTH is that all things are connected, and the mental labels of "good" and "bad" are ultimately illusory and come from a limited perspective

Heaven is real. It is here, and it is NOW. It just requires your presence to see it

***Internalize this in each moment***

Not the hope that this will work out well

But that ***it already is well***

Much more so than you even have the capacity to realize
